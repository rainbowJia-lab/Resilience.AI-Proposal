An AI-Driven Dynamic Assessment Model of Psychological Resilience


Title

The Cognitive Revolution from “Unkillable” to “Stronger”：An AI-Driven Dynamic Assessment Model of Psychological Resilience


1. Abstract

Psychological resilience—the capacity to adapt and recover from stress—is hard to capture with static self-report surveys. We propose a real-time, AI-driven model that fuses speech, text, and wearable signals via a Transformer architecture to generate continuous resilience scores. A reinforcement-learning agent then delivers just-in-time, personalized interventions (breathing guides, affirmations, guided meditation, social prompts). We will validate our approach through simulated adversity tasks and a randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing AI-adaptive support versus a fixed-schedule control. This work aims to establish a truly dynamic, data-driven paradigm for resilience assessment and intervention.


2. Background & Motivation

2.1 Limitations of Traditional Methods
Self-report scales (e.g. CD-RISC) capture only snapshots and suffer recall bias.

2.2 Advantage of Multimodal AI
Corpora like DAIC-WOZ and CMU-MOSEI demonstrate that fusing audio, text and physiological data greatly improves emotion detection.

2.3 Gap from Measurement to Action
Static assessments delay intervention; Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) promise immediate, personalized support.

Adults 18–65, randomized to AI-adaptive vs. fixed-schedule control.

4.2 Data Streams
(1) Public Corpora: MMPsy, DAIC-WOZ, CMU-MOSEI.
(2) Digital Reports: Social-media (Twitter/Reddit/Weibo), smartphone EMA & wearables (mood, HR).
(3) Lab Simulations: Puzzles, mock interviews; record ECG (HR/HRV), GSR, EEG/eye-tracking, audio/video, self-reports.


5. Data Processing & Features

| Modality       | Features & Tools                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Text           | BERT embeddings; VADER sentiment polarity      |
| Speech         | MFCCs; Wav2Vec 2.0 representations             |
| Physiology     | HRV (SDNN, LF/HF); GSR sliding-window features |
| Wearables      | SpO₂; sleep duration; EMA mood scores          |


6. Model & Intervention

6.1 Dynamic Assessment
(1) Transformer-based multimodal encoder with modality-specific subnets + positional encoding
(2) Pretrain (BERT, Wav2Vec) → fine-tune on labeled data → predict resilience score (0–100)

6.2 Adaptive Intervention
(1) RL agent selects What (breathing, affirmation, meditation, social) and When (JIT triggers)
(2) Rewards: ΔHRV, mood gains, ΔCD-RISC
